Hello! I’m [**Chinmay Dhanraj Nehate**](#), a graduate student at the [**University of Central Florida (UCF)**](https://www.ucf.edu), currently working on my thesis in **Robust Deep Learning for Class-Imbalanced Datasets**. I’m passionate about [**Software Engineering**](#) and [**Deep Learning**](#), striving to bridge AI with real-world applications through reliable, end-to-end solutions. Before UCF, I served as a **Senior Associate in Software Engineering** at [**Telstra**](https://www.telstra.com), where I contributed to eSIM feature development, code reviews, and robust software architectures. I earned my **Bachelor’s in Electronics Engineering** from [**Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI)**](https://www.vjti.ac.in) under [**Mumbai University**](https://mu.ac.in), gaining hands-on experience in **sensor fusion**, **hardware–software integration**, **robotics**, and **autonomous systems**. Whether refining deep learning models or building scalable software pipelines, I aim to deliver practical, high-impact technology.
