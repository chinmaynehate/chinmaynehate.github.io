Hello! I am an M.S. student at the [University of Central Florida (UCF)](https://www.ucf.edu), advised by [Prof. Shahana Ibrahim](https://shahana-ibrahim.github.io/). My research interests include **robust deep learning** under class-imbalance, **domain adaptation**, and **adversarial robustness** in modern AI systems.

I serve as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at UCF, guiding undergraduates in robotics fundamentals and software engineering practices. Before starting my M.S., I worked as a **Senior Associate in Software Engineering** at [Telstra](https://www.telstra.com), focusing on eSIM feature development, code reviews, and building reliable software architectures.

I completed my B.Tech. in Electronics Engineering (2017–2021) at [Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI)](https://www.vjti.ac.in) under [Mumbai University](https://mu.ac.in). At VJTI, I was a core member of the [Society of Robotics and Automation (SRA)](https://sravjti.in/), gaining hands-on experience in **sensor fusion**, **hardware–software integration**, and **robotics**.
